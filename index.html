        <p>The Uchiha Clan (うちは一族, Uchiha Ichizoku) is one of the four noble clans of Konohagakure,[1] reputed to be the village's strongest because of their Sharingan and natural battle prowess.[2] After helping found Konoha decades ago, the Uchiha grew increasingly isolated from the village's affairs, culminating in most of their deaths during the Uchiha Clan Downfall. Few Uchiha now survive into the present day.</p>

        <p>The Uchiha Clan Downfall (うちは一族滅亡, Uchiha Ichizoku Metsubō), also called the Uchiha Incident (うちはの事件, Uchiha no Jiken),[1] was the near-complete massacre of the Uchiha clan, perpetrated by Itachi Uchiha and — unbeknownst to most — a man claiming to be Madara Uchiha.</p>

        <p>Itachi Uchiha (うちはイタチ, Uchiha Itachi) was a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan who served as an Anbu Captain. He later became an international criminal after murdering his entire clan, sparing only his younger brother, Sasuke. He afterwards joined the international criminal organisation known as Akatsuki, whose activity brought him into frequent conflict with Konoha and its ninja — including Sasuke who sought to avenge their clan by killing Itachi.</p>
